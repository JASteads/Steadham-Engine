# Steadham-Engine
A primitive game engine that I made in 2019. It was designed for practice and some fun. For viewing purposes only.

Wanna try out the engine? You can download a compressed version on my Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s8zOE4cx-VmvWTKf2a2LVfLeqiN7DJb_/view?usp=sharing
